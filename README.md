# Heavy-metal-group-8
Investigating the effects of heavy metals deposition and toxicity accumulation on Reef Health due to on-shore Land Utilisation-group 8
1. Scientific question

The Effect of nutrient, heavy metal concentration and deposition is subjected to land degradation, industrial development and agricultural development 

3. Hypothesis

  a. There is a difference in run-off between industrial areas and ecological areas, impacting coral health from catchment sources through industrial advancement in the GBR
  b. There is no difference in run-off between industrial development and natural ecosystem affecting coral health at the GBR

7. Summary
Heavy metal concentrations are known to come from the catchment. They dissipate into the ocean and can be classed under dust, run-offs, particle matter, sedimentation or nutrients. The accumulation of these particles affects the ocean chemistry, which in turn has negative consequences for the health of the reefs. This study is to investigate the source of pollution to the GBR by comparing sites from less industrialised areas (Cape York) and highly industrialised areas (Mackay).
